Many who have tested it for me have felt very uneasy or paranoid and claim that a figure is hovering over them until eventually they strike.  Anyone who has experienced this have seen different faces of the attacker but the very first one to see him saw he had no face and razer sharp teeth.  We like to call him the faceless mind.  If your are watching this please use headphones and listen to this in a dark place with your eyes closed.  In my opinion this is probably my best work thus far and I am almost addicted to the thought of using it again for some reason.",

'Zone out' and refrain from being distracted. Set the volume as loud as possible but not loud enough to hurt your ears.\n\nEffects:\nMeditative state with increased focus.  As the 'dose' duration increases, a trance-like state is induced.  Repeated sequential use will induce deep sleep.\n\nNotes:\nMay produce mild hallucinogenic effects depending on the duration of the 'dose' and the initial state of mind. Stopping the dose abruptly may cause symptoms of a 'crash' - fear, rapid heartbeat, feeling of falling, and distorted depth perception.\n\nUSE AT YOUR OWN RISK. Not recommended for anyone with heart problems or epilepsy. By using this audio sample, you accept full responsibility for any consequences resulting thereof.\n\nThis is a PUBLIC DOMAIN, NON-COPYRIGHTED audio sample you may use freely and distribute freely WITHOUT CHARGE. This is a binaural beat experiment.\n\nPlease let me know your experience with this 'dose' in the comments section.",

    "description" : "vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv (*NEW*) DIY astral projection formula vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv\n\nTake your consciousness out of your body and into the astral plane with this simple meditation. It definitively works, if it doesn't give you vibrations the first time, try try again.\n\nPRACTICE ON YOUR OWN:\nYou have to keep your awareness pin pointed and focused on your intent to project, without having any thoughts about it. Its hard to explain how to do this unless you have achieved the vibrational stage once before, which is the point of the video. It helps you achieve this state so that you can do it later on your own, it is not meant to help you have a full projection.\n\nPractice meditation, that is coming into, what I like to call, the future-present moment, that is NOW, which almost all awareness of NOW is actually the past, it has already happened. When you click into the now, you sort of feel a WHOOSH in your head. You notice this when you are in danger or sometimes when someone is yelling at you, or when you are in great pain, etc. However, at least for me, I have a hard time making the future-present, some call it the Tao, last long, however staying in what most people call the present instead of thinking about the past or the projected future, can help you achieve the Tao.\n\nAstral projection is best done an hour or two before sunrise (4:30) you want to move to your couch or meditation room, etc, but not your bed. Then meditate as best as you can. When you are in the Now as best as you can be, your thoughts all stop. If you are thinking, you are not in the Now. You cannot STOP thinking, but you can move into the present and realize you are not the thinker. I sometimes like to do this as a practice to help, think this over and over until you understand (not THINK you understand): \"This voice is not you, I am the thinker, you are the observer\" After a few minutes of this you might start to realize that the voice that is saying that is NOT you at all, but rather just a voice, and you are the observing presence, listening to that voice, but only with a portion of the awareness available to you. -- Another good practice is to sit down in front of your computer and type something. Realize that the part of you that is coming up with the words and the physical body that is typing is not you, but rather a part of you that you are the observer of. This helps you achieve the dissociation from mind and body needed to become soul and thus leave your body. -- Back to it being 4:30, you are laying (if you choose to lay, support your mid and lower back with a pillow, to hold the curvature of your spine, your head pillow should be mostly supporting the curvature of your neck, I use a down pillow because I can move the bulk of feathers to the lower part of the pillow so it supports only my neck and very little of my head. Bend your left leg so that your left foot is touching just above your right inner knee on the Thy. The right knee should be bent slightly), or sitting, there meditating feeling the Tao, you will notice that the future-present moment WHOOSHES are more frequent here. Your breathings should be constant, not pausing after the out breath or the in breath, in the nose, out the nose, and in again. If you can visualize well, it would be best to walk around your apartment, pick things up, etc etc. If not, look through your inner eye while you are meditating, this will look like an iridescent swirl of colors, for me mostly purple, but it almost has a black quality to it, its very subtle, nothing like http://tinyurl.com/cm7xtab which is what you see when you push on your eyes. The moving colors you see are like amorphous blobs and they almost seem random. This is a good opportunity to practice a skill you need when you are visualizing, to see them with your inner eye and resist the urge to try to look around with the physical ones, this will help you forget your physical eyes and keep your inner eye open which you need for astral projection. Most people close their inner eye with the physical, practice until you can keep it open.-- Here you want to fall asleep, with your inner eye open, and your awareness keen on watching them. You will start to pulsate and buzz, feel almost an electrical feeling, here popping sounds that may be quite startling, and then you will see the room you are in, even through your eyes are closed, you will be floating, and you may even roll, your arms going through your mattress and walls! Now its time to apply a separation technique: http://tinyurl.com/csb9dyh goes with this: http://tinyurl.com/ccjqorz\n\nNow that you are out of your body, there are some simple commands that you can issue to get full control. I call them the 3 C's! \"CONTROL NOW! CONSCIOUSNESS NOW! CLARITY NOW\" The first allowing you total control over your movements. The second giving you total awareness of self and thus control over Direction. The third giving you total crystal clarity of vision, so that you can see All",

    "description" : "vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv (*NEW*) DIY astral projection formula vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv\n\nTake your consciousness out of your body and into the astral plane with this simple meditation. It definitively works, if it doesn't give you vibrations the first time, try try again.\n\nPRACTICE ON YOUR OWN:\nYou have to keep your awareness pin pointed and focused on your intent to project, without having any thoughts about it. Its hard to explain how to do this unless you have achieved the vibrational stage once before, which is the point of the video. It helps you achieve this state so that you can do it later on your own, it is not meant to help you have a full projection.\n\nPractice meditation, that is coming into, what I like to call, the future-present moment, that is NOW, which almost all awareness of NOW is actually the past, it has already happened. When you click into the now, you sort of feel a WHOOSH in your head. You notice this when you are in danger or sometimes when someone is yelling at you, or when you are in great pain, etc. However, at least for me, I have a hard time making the future-present, some call it the Tao, last long, however staying in what most people call the present instead of thinking about the past or the projected future, can help you achieve the Tao.\n\nAstral projection is best done an hour or two before sunrise (4:30) you want to move to your couch or meditation room, etc, but not your bed. Then meditate as best as you can. When you are in the Now as best as you can be, your thoughts all stop. If you are thinking, you are not in the Now. You cannot STOP thinking, but you can move into the present and realize you are not the thinker. I sometimes like to do this as a practice to help, think this over and over until you understand (not THINK you understand): \"This voice is not you, I am the thinker, you are the observer\" After a few minutes of this you might start to realize that the voice that is saying that is NOT you at all, but rather just a voice, and you are the observing presence, listening to that voice, but only with a portion of the awareness available to you. -- Another good practice is to sit down in front of your computer and type something. Realize that the part of you that is coming up with the words and the physical body that is typing is not you, but rather a part of you that you are the observer of. This helps you achieve the dissociation from mind and body needed to become soul and thus leave your body. -- Back to it being 4:30, you are laying (if you choose to lay, support your mid and lower back with a pillow, to hold the curvature of your spine, your head pillow should be mostly supporting the curvature of your neck, I use a down pillow because I can move the bulk of feathers to the lower part of the pillow so it supports only my neck and very little of my head. Bend your left leg so that your left foot is touching just above your right inner knee on the Thy. The right knee should be bent slightly), or sitting, there meditating feeling the Tao, you will notice that the future-present moment WHOOSHES are more frequent here. Your breathings should be constant, not pausing after the out breath or the in breath, in the nose, out the nose, and in again. If you can visualize well, it would be best to walk around your apartment, pick things up, etc etc. If not, look through your inner eye while you are meditating, this will look like an iridescent swirl of colors, for me mostly purple, but it almost has a black quality to it, its very subtle, nothing like http://tinyurl.com/cm7xtab which is what you see when you push on your eyes. The moving colors you see are like amorphous blobs and they almost seem random. This is a good opportunity to practice a skill you need when you are visualizing, to see them with your inner eye and resist the urge to try to look around with the physical ones, this will help you forget your physical eyes and keep your inner eye open which you need for astral projection. Most people close their inner eye with the physical, practice until you can keep it open.-- Here you want to fall asleep, with your inner eye open, and your awareness keen on watching them. You will start to pulsate and buzz, feel almost an electrical feeling, here popping sounds that may be quite startling, and then you will see the room you are in, even through your eyes are closed, you will be floating, and you may even roll, your arms going through your mattress and walls! Now its time to apply a separation technique: http://tinyurl.com/csb9dyh goes with this: http://tinyurl.com/ccjqorz\n\nNow that you are out of your body, there are some simple commands that you can issue to get full control.

Please click the link below or in the video if you like this idea.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/sleep-hypnosis-easy-lucid/id695867907\nThis is over one hour of the newest and best techniques I could gather for lucid dream induction. Some of the methods applied here are not exactly new and have been practised by Yogis for thousands of years. I call them new because they may be new to those searching for a lucid dreaming experience on youtube. Hypnosis, guided visualisation, meditation, rotation of consciousness, and whatever else I could think of that could be fun has been included. This a very relaxing and enjoyable way to be guided into sleep and/or a lucid dream. I hope you have an interesting sleep with this. Sweet dreams. Jody.",

Lowers mental fatigue\r\n•4 - 7 Hz - Deep meditation, near-sleep brainwaves\r\n\r\n---------------- What are theta brainwaves? ---------------\r\n\r\nTheta brainwaves are considered extremely relaxing brainwave activity that is commonly associated with sleep and dreaming. Theta brainwaves are high in amplitude and cycle within the range of 4 -- 8 Hz and are usually generated in the brains right hemisphere. Theta waves kick in when we feel emotional, relaxed, daydreamy, unfocused, or are asleep. Theta brainwaves are generally thought of as the brainwaves that are dominant in people with A.D.D., high levels of relaxation, high levels of creativity, and random thinking. The theta brainwave is considered the brainwave pattern that is dominant in deeply relaxed, dream sleep.\r\n\r\nTheta brain waves typically range from 4 Hz to 8 Hz. Theta brain waves are associated with the \"subconscious mind\" and are usually produced in the right-hemisphere of the brain - as opposed to beta brain waves, which are produced in the left-hemisphere and are associated with the \"conscious mind.\" The brain creates theta brain wave rhythms each time you are in \"dream sleep.\" Also, during R.E.M. [Rapid-Eye Movement] sleep, the brain is full of theta brain wave activity.\r\n\r\nNearly 3/5 of your entire time spent sleeping at night involves the production of theta brain waves in your brain. Many individuals also are able to access theta brain waves when they are: driving for a long stretch on the highway, practicing their meditation routine, using a self-hypnosis recording, or practicing other forms of deep relaxation. When you are able to consciously access the alpha brain waves state, you are just one step away from accessing the depths of theta.\r\n\r\nWhat's cool about theta brain waves is the fact that they allow you to connect with your \"subconscious mind.\" The subconscious mind is the place where all experiences, long-term memories, natural creativity, powerful emotions, spiritual connections, and inspiration are all stored. Think of the \"subconscious mind\" as one big, infinite storage space for \"everything\" in your life. The theta brain waves are extremely helpful for healing the body of injury and the mind of diseased-states\r\n\r\n--------------Benefits of increasing theta brainwaves----------\r\n\r\n•Deep levels of relaxation\r\n•Bridges the spiritual connection\r\n•O.O.B.E. , Astral Projection, Esp, Other related phenomenon\r\n•Advanced intuition\r\n•Subconscious connection\r\n•Ability to program subconscious mind\r\n•Emotional connection\r\n•Peak levels of creativity\r\n•Advanced problem solving skills\r\n•Large boost in learning ability\r\n•Improved long-term memory\r\n•Ability to hyperfocus\r\n•Lower anxiety, stress, and neurosis\r\n•Healing of body and mind\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------­­-------\r\n\r\nTo find more detailed information on Binaural Beats and Brainwaves please visit -\r\n\r\nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/8179111/Binaural-Beats-Complete...\r\n\r\nAll Information provided by above link.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to rip and use this video for whatever is needed.

    "description" : "Video: - (20hz) Beat Frequency - - (190hz) Base Frequency -\r\n\r\nBeta Brain Waves Information ( 13 to 30Hz) :\r\n\r\n•14 Hz - Awakeness, alert. Concentration on tasks, Focusing, vitality.\r\n•16 Hz - Bottom of hearing range. Releases oxygen/calcium into cells\r\n•12 - 15 Hz - Relaxed focus, improved attentive abilities\r\n•13 - 27 Hz - Promotes focused attention toward external stimuli\r\n•13 - 30 Hz - Problem solving, conscious thinking\r\n•18-24 Hz — Euphoria, can result in headaches, anxiety\r\n\r\n---------------- What are beta brainwaves? ---------------\r\n\r\nBeta brainwaves are considered \"fast brain wave\" activity. Beta brainwaves are brainwaves that\r\ncycle within the range of 12 -- 38 Hz and are usually generated in the brain's left-hemisphere.\r\n\r\nBeta waves kick in when logically thinking, feeling stressed, and feeling tense. Beta is generally\r\nthought of as a \"normal\" rhythm and is dominant in people who are alert, anxious, or have their\r\neyes open. Beta brainwaves are considered to be the normal brainwave pattern in healthy adults.\r\n\r\nMost children and teenagers have dominant theta and alpha brainwave patterns. There isn't a\r\nsingle brain wave pattern is better than the others -- so don't think beta brainwaves are some sort\r\nof miracle that your children need! If you happen to be deficient in the beta brain wave range,\r\nincreasing them may feel like a miracle!\r\n\r\n--------------Benefits of increasing beta brainwaves-----------\r\n\r\n•Ability to think quickly\r\n•Highest levels of focus\r\n•Goal oriented\r\n•Increase in I.Q\r\n•Become more social\r\n•More energy\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------WARNING-----------\r\n\r\nAs goes for anything, too much beta activity can be a bad thing. By no means would it be a good idea for you to increase a brainwave that you already have high levels of. In fact, there is a real possibility you may experience the negative effects of beta brainwaves, as they can cause anxiety, muscle tension, paranoia, and other related \"stressful\" effects.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------­-------\r\n\r\nTo find more detailed information on Binaural Beats and Brainwaves please visit -\r\n\r\nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/8179111/Binaural-Beats-Complete...\r\n\r\nAll Information provided by above link.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to rip and use this video for whatever is needed.
